# JavaScript Assignment
by. Juho Simojoki

## Description

This "project" consists of only some JavaScript assignments, mini tasks, done for Integrify Finland Full Stack Academy, that are separate and have nothing to do with each other. They are just some debugging and algorithm training. All of the mini tasks can be found in the index.js file. If you want to have output, you need to comment out all the console.logs.

* Assignments are described in the index.js
* No extra library should be installed to help with JavaScript assignment.
